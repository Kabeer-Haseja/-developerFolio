# Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Deployment Issues Fixed**

The following issues have been resolved for successful Vercel deployment:

### 1. **React Hooks Rule Violation**
- **Fixed**: Moved `useEffect` hook before conditional return in `SocialMedia.js`
- **Issue**: React Hooks must be called in the same order every render

### 2. **Build Configuration**
- **Added**: `vercel.json` configuration file
- **Added**: `.vercelignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
- **Removed**: `homepage` field from `package.json` (conflicts with Vercel routing)

### 3. **Dependencies**
- **Verified**: All dependencies are properly installed
- **Confirmed**: Build process works locally

## 🚀 **Deploy to Vercel**

### Option 1: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? [Y/n] Y
# - Which scope? (your username)
# - Link to existing project? [y/N] N
# - Project name: (accept default or customize)
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
```

### Option 2: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Create React App
5. Click "Deploy"

## ⚙️ **Environment Variables (Optional)**

If you want to enable GitHub data fetching:

1. In Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables

   - `GITHUB_USERNAME` = `your-github-username`
   - `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` = `your-github-token`
   - `MEDIUM_USERNAME` = `your-medium-username` (optional)
